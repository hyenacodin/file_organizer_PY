# file_organizer_PY
file organizer built in python, has a simple gui interface with a browse button, this program would organize files based on their extensions.

For example if you have .doc and .exe files on desktop, it would simple create a new folder with the extension name, and put the correspanding files in.

i've also included an exe file that ive compiled, any technically challanged peep can use this for their convenience.
